# HANDOVER.md

State of play, for whoever picks this up next — including a fresh Claude Code
session, which will have read the files but not the conversation that produced
them.

Everything factual lives in `ENGINE_SPEC_v0.3.md` and `DECISIONS.md`. This file
carries the things those two cannot: where we are, how we work, and what is
still resting on a guess.

---

## Where we are

**Every build-order step is done.** 922 tests, all passing, 1 todo.

```
✅  1  constants, money, rng          ✅  8  pacing, attribution
✅  2  querySet + content             ✅  9  round
✅  3  auction                        ✅ 10  report, insights
✅  4  matching                       ✅ 11  serialise
✅  5  quality                        ✅ 12  calibration
✅  6  positions                      🟨 13  agents  — llmPolicy + queryGen left
✅  7  strategies                     🟨 14  ui      — slices 1 and 2 done
```

Plus three modules the spec's layout never had, all of them caller-layer:

| | what it is |
|---|---|
| `game.js` | the round loop. Diffs decisions and writes learning periods (12.3), appends to `decisionLog` (12.4), attaches each advertiser's own Quality Score (15.2). |
| `setup.js` | round 0 (§17). Seeded rival placement, the briefing, the player's opening decisions, and the one redo (17.3). It is in NO build-order step — the order predates `game.js`. |
| `dev-server.js` | 40 lines of `node:http` so `ui/` can import the real engine. `npm run dev`. |

**It is playable.** `npm run dev`, then http://localhost:5173. Round 0 asks for
brand, position, capital, keywords, ad copy and a weekly split; the dashboard
plays a week at a time against six rule-based rivals.

All five calibration invariants pass. Neither `CALIBRATE` constant moved without
argument:

| | value | why it is where it is |
|---|---|---|
| `AD_RANK_FLOOR` | 60 | Raising it is regressive. A flat reserve takes the same absolute paise from every cell — a small bite out of Premium's ceiling, a fatal one out of Value's. Floor 150 takes I3 from 2.8% to 50.8%; 250 wipes the Value tier out. |
| `WEEKLY_VOLUME` | 350000 | Pinned from both sides. Below ~315,000 I1 fails — a competently covered advertiser cannot exhaust its month. Above ~375,000 I3 fails — the flat budget cap bites unequally across break-evens differing 2.7x. |

I3 sits at **2.8% worst deviation, 1.05x spread** against a 15% target.

## What is next: slice three of the interface

The dashboard shows a week. Round 0 opens the account. **Nothing lets the player
change anything between weeks**, which is the whole game.

`ui/app.js` already passes `() => null` as the player's controller, so the seam
exists: a controller returns `{ campaign, adGroups }` and `game.js` does the
rest — it diffs against the previous state, writes the learning period when
12.3 says to, and logs the decision. Slice three fills that return value from a
form.

What the form needs, in rough order of how much it teaches:

1. **Negatives written straight from the search terms report.** 8.2 makes that
   report the only tool for writing them, and 15.2 makes it a primary surface.
   The table already marks rows that took clicks and returned nothing. A button
   on the row is the whole interaction, and it is the most valuable thing in the
   slice.
2. **Bids and match types per keyword**, plus adding and removing keywords. The
   tagger runs offline, so a new keyword can be tagged as it is typed.
3. **Bid strategy and its parameter.** Changing either triggers a learning
   period (12.3), and `game.js` already detects that — the form must SAY so
   before the player commits, or the penalty arrives unexplained.
4. **The weekly split**, against the burn-down the dashboard already draws.
5. **Dayparting**, six blocks. The least urgent: nothing in the interface yet
   shows the hourly pattern that would make it a reasoned choice rather than a
   guess.

Two things to respect. **A decision must be previewable before it is
committed** — the whole design is about acting on incomplete information, and a
form that hides consequences it could show is being cruel rather than honest.
Changing a bid strategy is the sharp case: it triggers a learning period (12.3),
`game.js` already detects it, and if the interface does not say so BEFORE the
player commits, the penalty lands two rounds later with nothing connecting it to
the cause. That is the confusion this simulator exists to teach deliberately,
not to inflict by accident.

And **the view may not compute economics**: `tests/ui.test.js` fails if a `ui/`
file names a constant it should import, and that guard has already fired once
and was right.

**What finished looks like.** A player who opens the account into a losing
position can read the search terms report, see which searches are taking their
money, block them, move their bids, and watch it change over the following
weeks. That is currently impossible — the account this session played into
premium|lifestyle bought Value-tier traffic because the keyword planner sorts by
volume, lost money for three straight weeks, and had no way to do anything about
it. Slice three is done when that account can be rescued.

## What the last session changed, and why it matters

An audit pass found nineteen things. Four were already covered by the ledger and
were withdrawn or narrowed — that is the system working. The rest produced eight
commits, and three of them were engine defects producing wrong numbers:

- **Reports were double-counting their own lag-0 conversions.** `runRound`
  appended the fresh report to history and then revised the whole array,
  including that report, so 55% of every advertiser's conversions landed twice.
  Round 1 stored 131.33 where `runRound` returned 65.66. Eight revision tests
  missed it because they all compared `R1.report` against `history`, and the
  defect lived exactly in the gap between those two objects.
- **`observedConvRate` was never written.** It stayed null for twelve rounds
  while `observedConversions` climbed into the hundreds, so smart bidding grew
  steadily more confident about `COLD_START_CONV_RATE`. The spec-19 test for it
  was never written, and every strategies test supplied the value by hand.
- **`observedByHour` was hard-coded null**, so `MIN_HOUR_OBSERVATIONS` was
  unreachable and a bid strategy had no route to dayparting at all.

And one design defect worth understanding before touching anything:

- **The purpose axis was applied twice.** `PURPOSE_MODIFIERS` *and* the query
  set, which gives lifestyle territory bigger baskets and fewer returns. Both
  are true; both push the same way. The realised purpose gap was 12/17/20%
  against I4's 15% bound, invisible because **I4 read `constants.js` and
  nothing else** — it measured a quantity no auction experiences. Fixed by
  shrinking the `INVENTED` modifier rather than flattening the argued content.

---

## The thing that governs everything downstream

**`breakEvenCpcPaise` is not the number an advertiser can pay.** It is the
ceiling on a neutral query — every multiplier 1, every hour average — and nobody
buys that query. Territory is by construction where both of a position's
affinities peak, so the affinity product runs near 2.0, and the intent curve
compounds it (its mean is 1 over uniform hours and **1.146 over traffic**).

Use **`realisedBreakEvenCpcPaise`** for anything operational. The old figure had
the fixtures bidding 29% of what they could afford, which is why the market read
as placid and everyone priced against the reserve. Corrected, median CPC went
979 → 2008 and `lostToBudget` started firing for the first time.

---

## Is twelve rounds long enough to learn from?

Measured rather than argued, because W11 was closed by design argument alone.
Short answer: **long enough for anything that settles inside a round, not long
enough for the three lessons the design cares most about.**

- **A round's reported profit overshoots.** 64% of truth at the click, **117%
  one round later**, then four rounds of decay. Conversions land faster than
  returns resolve, so every round looks best exactly one round after you stopped
  being able to change it.
- **Five of the eleven decisions in a game are made with no settled round to
  look at.** First fully-settled feedback arrives at round 7.
- **The quality diagnostic never moves.** Lifting `expectedCtr` 6 → 9 — a 50%
  improvement — moves the own/field ratio from 1.137 to 1.488 over eight rounds
  and the displayed score not at all, because the ratio was already past
  `RATING_UPPER_THRESHOLD` and three levels cannot express anything between.
  A6 records this as landing-page compression; it is every component.
- **The noise floor is flat.** `QUALITY_NOISE_SIGMA` is a volume-independent 8%
  that swamps the Poisson term, so every advertiser sits at 9-10% CV regardless
  of size. **F7's Premium claim does not hold on reported outcomes** — 10.5%
  against 8.8%, not the 3x it describes. It *does* hold on the bid strategy's
  internal estimate: sigma 0.141 against 0.050 at round 12.

None of that needs a longer game. The cheapest fixes are display-side and
constant-side, and they have not been discussed yet.

---

## Still open

- **`agents/` needs `llmPolicy.js` and `queryGen.js`.** §2 asks for two of eight
  rivals to be Claude-backed; the market already has six distinct characters
  without it, so this is optional in a way the others were not. `queryGen` is
  arguably already done by hand — the set is frozen and 7.1 says it is generated
  once then hand-corrected, so building a generator now would regenerate an
  artefact reviewed twice.
- **`grader.js` and `keywordTagger.js` are built but only ever run offline.**
  Both take their transport as an argument and `agents/claude.js` supplies a
  real one; nothing has yet passed it. The first live model call in this project
  has not been made.
- **The query set was reviewed once** and Value and Premium were rewritten after
  that review. The corrected set has still not been read end to end.
- **`content/adCopy.js` is read and corrected.** One detail unverified: whether
  Japanese and Korean yarn is what Indian premium activewear signals with, or
  whether it is recycled technical fabric or a named mill.
- **The W11 display findings are unactioned.** A round's reported profit peaks
  at 117% of truth one round after the click and decays for four more; a 50%
  real improvement in ad quality never moves the reported score, because the
  ratio was already past 1.10 and three levels cannot express anything between.
  Both are design conversations, not defects.
- **There is no linter.** `ui/dashboard.js` shipped a `ReferenceError` to the
  browser that a 917-test suite could not see, because no test reads function
  bodies. `tests/ui.test.js` has a module-load smoke test that is labelled weak
  on purpose. This is the one gap where a dependency would genuinely pay.
- **Nobody has played it as a learner.** It has been driven end to end from a
  script and read on screen, which is not the same thing.

## How this project works

**Tests first, then implementation, then run and iterate.** Every step so far:
write the test file, write the module, run, fix, commit, push. `npm test`.

**Commit and push after every green run.** Credentials are cached, so pushing
needs no interaction. Commit messages are long on purpose — they carry the
reasoning that would otherwise be lost.

**Run diagnostics, not just tests.** Several of the most useful findings came
from a throwaway script printing real numbers, not from an assertion. The
pacing stutter, the fixture's impossible bids, the 43% gross/net gap being a
base-tier figure — all found by looking at output. Scratchpad scripts for this
live outside the repo.

**Mutation-test anything that validates.** A validator that always returns
"valid" passes a naive suite perfectly. `querySet.test.js` breaks exactly one
rule at a time and asserts that rule fires; `brands.test.js` proves its guard
would reject `BudgetBox`.

**Structural tests where a rule cannot be tested behaviourally.** You cannot
prove a module ignored a field it was handed, so instead: `quality.test.js`
reads every file in `engine/` and fails if any but `quality.js` so much as
writes `reportedScore`; `strategies.test.js` fails if that module names an
affinity; `serialise.test.js` fails if it could reach a model. These have fired
three times and were right every time.

---

## The pattern worth knowing

**Building a module keeps finding defects in the spec that reading it did not.**
Roughly a dozen so far, all recorded in `DECISIONS.md`. Three examples, because
the shape repeats:

- Spec 12.1 and 14 both listed `business.convRateBase` *and* the purpose
  modifier. But `businessFor` already folds the modifier in — it has to, or the
  break-even table would be wrong. Applying it again would have made every
  lifestyle brand convert 1.21× and return 1.44× more than designed. **When a
  derived object and a formula both mention the same modifier, one of them is
  wrong.** (F10)
- `DECISIONS.md` D9 claimed the generic pacing curve manufactures the forecast
  error the 2× overspend cap needs. Measured, it produces 0.2% overspend — the
  hourly feedback loop is too tight. The entry is corrected in place, and what
  the mismatch actually costs (mis-timed spend, an account broke before its best
  hours) turned out to be the better lesson.
- Spec 10.2 would have let a *below-floor* rival set your price, so adding a
  weak competitor would have **lowered** your cost. The floor is a reserve, not
  just an eligibility gate. (B5)

So: **treat the spec as authoritative but not correct.** If something reads
oddly while implementing it, it is worth ten minutes of arithmetic.

---

## Decisions taken by recommendation rather than discussion

- **The three `RoundReport` sub-questions**: no rival rows in an advertiser's
  slice, breakdown per keyword *and* per query, and `AsFirstReported` twins on
  every revised figure. All built and tested; worth confirming they are what was
  wanted.
- **`PURPOSE_MODIFIERS.conv` is 0.94/1.06**, chosen so the *realised* purpose gap
  lands where spec 4.4 always claimed it was. The alternative was flattening the
  query set's baskets and returns, which would have asserted something false
  about apparel to protect an invariant. See `DECISIONS.md` F11.
- **Ad copy grades sit on the rival, not the cell** (`adCopy.js`), so position
  cannot carry hidden ad quality. Challenge it if you disagree.

---


## Things that will bite

- **The shell has a stale PATH.** Node is at `C:\Program Files\nodejs`; prepend
  it (`$env:Path = "C:\Program Files\nodejs;" + $env:Path`) in every PowerShell
  call or `node` is not found.
- **Commit messages must go through a file.** `git commit -F <file>`; PowerShell
  here-strings mangle embedded quotes and git receives the message as filenames.
- **`engine-audit.test.mjs`** at the repo root is a v0.1 prototype artefact that
  cannot run. `vitest.config.js` excludes it deliberately. Its `BUG CHECK` cases
  encode real traps and have been ported as their modules were built.
- **The two `.jsx` prototypes are gone**, and the reason is worth keeping. Each
  carried its OWN demand curve, conversion multipliers and auction, so once a
  real interface existed they looked like the UI and agreed with nothing.
  `git log` still has them if anything needs salvaging. `ui/` imports the real
  engine and `tests/ui.test.js` fails if that ever stops — which is the guard
  that replaced them.
- **`files.zip`** at the root holds a `CLAUDE.md` and `DECISIONS.md` from before
  the first commit, so git never captured them. Kept as provenance, not code.
- **The performance suite runs alone**, via `npm run test:perf` and its own
  config. Inside the parallel suite the same round reported 496ms and 1991ms
  twenty seconds apart, and switching to CPU time only moved the problem — GC
  under that much memory pressure is real CPU. A timing assertion that fires on
  machine weather is worse than none, because it teaches you to rerun until it
  passes.

### The one that will cost you an afternoon

- **A player decision must be RETURNED from a controller, never written into
  state.** `playRound` collects what each controller returns and hands it to
  `submitRound`, and `submitRound` is what applies structural changes, writes
  the learning period when 12.3 says to, and appends to `decisionLog` for
  12.4's replay. Reaching into `game.state.advertisers[0]` from the interface
  and editing a bid there produces a game that runs, looks right, and silently
  never triggers a learning period or logs a decision. Three mechanics gone,
  no error. This is the exact shape of half the defects this project has found.

### Verifying the interface

- **Screenshots lie when the browser pane is hidden.** The viewport collapses,
  `window.innerWidth` reads 0, every card measures 32px and the page reports
  horizontal overflow. It is indistinguishable from a layout bug. When that
  happens, read the DOM with `javascript_tool` instead — measure
  `getBoundingClientRect()` and `innerHTML` rather than trusting a picture.
- **The console keeps errors across navigations.** Stale entries from a previous
  load read exactly like current failures, complete with line numbers from files
  that have since changed. Open a fresh tab to check whether an error is real.
- **The round 0 form rebuilds itself on every keystroke**, because each input
  calls `rerender()`. Driving it from a script means re-querying the element
  after every single change, and setting `.value` does nothing on its own —
  dispatch an `input` event or the handler never runs.

---

## Working preferences that shaped this

Stated in `CLAUDE.md` and worth repeating because they changed how the work was
done:

- Plan before code for anything non-trivial, and wait.
- Ask rather than assume. Guessing silently is the main failure mode being
  guarded against.
- One module at a time. Do not build ahead.
- Push back. Roughly forty spec problems were caught by two audit passes before
  a line was written, and a dozen more by building. Assume more remain.
- Explain technical things in plain language. A working file that cannot be
  followed is a failure even if the tests pass.
